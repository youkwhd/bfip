bfip
====

Brainfuck interpreter with REPL.

1) Installation
---------------

For anyone trying to install this from windows, I haven't tested
bfip to run in multiple OSes. Though, bfip is only configured for
UNIX in the time being.

Simply run this command:
    
    make

You've just compiled bfip, but haven't installed it to $PATH,
there should be a command equivalent to `make install` (haven't
implemented yet).

2) Usage
--------

    ./bfip -e [file...]

Just kidding, haven't parsed any arguments yet.

3) REPL Support
---------------

You said bfip has REPL, why is there no REPL available? please
note that bfip is still on the early stage of development,
currently there is no REPL implemented.
