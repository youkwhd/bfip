bfip
====

Brainfuck interpreter with REPL.

1) Installation
---------------

For anyone trying to install this from windows, I haven't tested
bfip to run in multiple OSes. Though, bfip is only configured for
UNIX in the time being.

Simply run this command:
    
    make

You've just compiled bfip, but haven't installed it to $PATH,
there should be a command equivalent to `make install` (haven't
implemented yet).

2) Usage
--------

Executing a Brainfuck program from a file:

    ./bfip file

To evaluate a single script of Brainfuck:

    ./bfip -e "++++++[>+++++++++>++<<-]>.+++.>--." 

See bfip(1) for more information.

3) REPL Support
---------------

You said bfip has REPL, why is there no REPL available? please
note that bfip is still on the early stage of development,
currently there is no REPL implemented.
