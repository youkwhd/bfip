bfip
====

Brainfuck interpreter.

1) Installation
---------------

I don't test bfip on windows, though it is tested on UNIX for the
time being. bfip should be just fine with windows. as there is no
platform specific code issued.

Simply run this command:
    
    make

For the time being, there is no command to install the binary.
Building bfip form scratch shouldn't consume much time.

2) Usage
--------

Executing a Brainfuck program from a file:

    ./bfip examples/hello_world.bf

To evaluate a single script of Brainfuck:

    ./bfip -e "++++++[>+++++++++>++<<-]>.+++.>--." 

See bfip(1) for more information.

3) REPL Support
---------------

If you really want to use a REPL so bad, consider checking out
this git commit: `6f30faa`.
